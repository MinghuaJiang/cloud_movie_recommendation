# movielens_movie_recommendation
UVA CS6501-010 Final Project

In this project, we will use the Movielens dataset and based on the instruction below to build a Spark Movie Recommendation Service using Flask.

We will further implement serveral different Movie Recommendation Algorithms and port the backend service on AWS.

Our final step is to build a web site like MoiveLens to recommend the films to the user using the backend service on the cloud.

Here is what we have to do:

1. Understand how Spark works

https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/
https://github.com/jadianes/spark-py-notebooks

2. Understand how to create Spark cluster on AWS.

3. Start up Spark locally and finish building the service based on instruction below(Collaborative Filtering)
